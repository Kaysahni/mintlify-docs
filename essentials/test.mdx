Permissions Requirements:

Google Cloud:

1. The following permissions are required by FluidCloud for your service account for creating resources as part of migration:
   Cloud quotas admin, Quota Administrator: FluidCloud migrations may require you to create more resources per project/region than the default quotas of the cloud account. Hence, kindly note the quotas before and make sure the right quotas are set before starting a migration or backup.
   Project Billing Manager:
   Project Mover/ Project Creator: Require to create a new project as part of migration
   Project IAM Admin
   Cloud Asset Viewer: Required to view and monitor the created assets.
   Service Usage Admin: Required to enable the required cloud billing API’s
   Create Service Accounts: To create the service account required for FluidCloud Account onboarding
2. Here is a list of permissions required for backing up services currently supported:

- Compute Instances: Compute Instance Admin (v1)
- Compute Network, Subnetworks and Firewalls: Compute Network Viewer, Firewall Recommender Viewer

Note: It is recommended that all the necessary cloud permissions are assigned to the service account added as part of FluidCloud account onboarding.

AWS:

1. Required: Access Key and Secret Key created for the IAM User in the source / target AWS Cloud Account .When deploying / migrating to AWS from other clouds / from one region in AWS to another, the following permissions are required by FluidCloud for your user:
   The list of services supported by FluidCloud as part of migration require the following permissions:
   EC2 Instances: AmazonEC2FullAccess
   VPC ,Subnets, Security Groups and Network Interfaces: AmazonVPCFullAccess,
2. Please follow the services you want to backup, and provide the necessary List / Get / Describe permissions. Example would be for S3 Backup when selecting AWS Account as a source, the required permission attached to the user whose Access key and Secret Key are provided during account on boarding would be AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess. Similarly make sure to provide read accesses for each service you want to back up.

AZURE:\
Required: For Azure account onboarding, a new app registration needs to be created, with details required:
TenantID, SubscriptionID, ClientID and ClientSecret.

Once an app registration is created you need to assign the necessary read permissions as follows for backing up your azure account:
Virtual Machines: Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read
Virtual Networks: Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read
Subnets: Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read
Network Security Groups: Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/read
Network Interfaces: Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/read
PublicIPAddresses: Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/read

For Azure account onboarding, a new app registration needs to be created, with details required for migrating resources from other cloud accounts to Azure / from one region in Azure to another:
Virtual Machines: Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write
Virtual Networks: Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/write
Subnets: Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/write
Network Security Groups: Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/write
Network Interfaces: Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/write
PublicIPAddresses: Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/write
Note: When onboarding the Azure Account, note that the location required is for resource groups, meaning all resource groups and the resources in those resource groups in that region / location will be backed up or selected for migration. This happens regardless of the actual location of the resources in those resource groups for the purpose of data and infrastructure consistency.

Database  Migration
Navigate to Migrations dashboard
Click on \+ New Migration button

Give a friendly name of your choice
Select Data as the migration type and click Configure Source

Select source Database Engine from the given options

You can choose from the list of previously added database hosts or connect to a new DB host by clicking on \+ button

Host: Database endpoint or the hostname of the database instance
Database: Database name inside the DB instance
Port: Listening port of the DB instance
Username & Password: User credentials to authenticate and establish active connection to the DB instance
Follow the same steps 5 through 10 for target database engine. User has a freedom to select a different database engine from the source or not.

Go ahead and create a database migration, a draft migration gets created and you are redirected to the Migrations Dashboard
Migration details page of a migration type Data will show visual representation of all the discovered tables and records in them with a small details of schema of table and the records and other useful information

When Launch Migration is triggered, the source database tables, indexes and all the relevant information get replicated on the target database.

Troubleshooting & Support
Common Issues & Fixes
Authentication Errors: Ensure API credentials are correct and active.
Slow Migrations: Large datasets can take longer; consider migrating in smaller batches.
